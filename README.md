# PyECN

PyECN is a python-based equivalent circuit network (ECN) framework for modelling lithium-ion batteries.


## Using PyECN

PyECN is run by providing `pyecn` with a configuration file for a simulation, containing details of a cell's geometrical, physical, electrical and thermal properties, as well as operating conditions. An example configuration file for a pouch cell is provided in `pouch.toml`:

```bash
$ python -m pyecn pouch.toml
```

PyECN can also be run in an interactive python session:

```bash
$ python
>>> import pyecn
>>> pyecn.run()
Enter config file name:
pouch.toml
```
